# Swaggy example
I created this project just present how to make swaggydocs work as it's pretty tricky and one can spent bunch of time just finding bugs (I myself did some serious plugin code digging to find out that you have to write controllers names starting with lower letters to make urls correct!)

Also this project is a part of answer in this topic http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35164199/swagger-2-0-support-in-grails-3-3-0-11-not-working where I explained step by step how to make swaggy work

## grails version: 3.1.4
